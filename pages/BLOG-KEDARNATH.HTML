                <h1>KEDARNATH MANDIR</h1><br><br>
                <p>The foundation of Kedarnath Temple is steeped in antiquity, believed to have been laid by the Pandavas during the Mahabharata era, though the current stone structure was established by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century. <br><br>This sacred temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, stands at an elevation of 3,583 meters in the Himalayas and is part of the Char Dham pilgrimage circuit, making it one of Hinduism's holiest sites. Nestled beside the Mandakini River, Kedarnath is surrounded by snow-capped peaks and a dramatic landscape that underscores its spiritual prominence.

                    Kedarnath Temple is the centerpiece of a larger complex of shrines, attracting pilgrims and adventurers from all over India. The main temple is built of large, intricately carved stones, and its sanctum houses a conical-shaped Shiva lingam, symbolizing the “Lord of Kedar Khand” (the local name for the region). This site is associated with multiple legends, including one where Lord Shiva took refuge here, avoiding the Pandavas, who were seeking his blessings for redemption. As the Pandavas followed him, Shiva transformed into a bull and dived into the ground, leaving only his hump above. It is this hump that is worshipped as the Shiva lingam within Kedarnath Temple.
                    <br><br>
                    The temple complex also houses several shrines dedicated to various deities and figures associated with the Mahabharata, and a pathway leads pilgrims up to the Bhairav Temple, which is dedicated to Bhairavnath, the temple guardian. Kedarnath remains open to worshippers for only six months of the year, closing during winter as the area becomes inaccessible due to heavy snowfall. The temple and surrounding pilgrimage sites are managed by the Uttarakhand Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, which oversees its upkeep and the annual opening and closing ceremonies.
                    
                    Kedarnath Temple symbolizes resilience and spiritual endurance, having survived natural disasters, including the 2013 Uttarakhand floods. The temple serves as a spiritual beacon, attracting devotees seeking solace, adventure, and a connection with the divine, further amplified by the rugged and pristine environment of the Himalayas.

                <h4>
                    According to the Sikh historical records, the land that became Amritsar and houses the Harimandir Sahib was chosen by Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of the Sikh tradition. It was then called Guru Da Chakk, after he had asked his disciple Ram Das to find land to start a new town with a man-made pool as its central point. After Guru Ram Das succeeded Guru Amar Das in 1574, and in the face of hostile opposition from the sons of Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das founded the town that came to be known as "Ramdaspur". He started by completing the pool with the help of Baba Buddha (not to be confused with the Buddha of Buddhism). Guru Ram Das built his new official centre and home next to it. He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle in the new town with him.

Ramdaspur town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The town grew to become the city of Amritsar, and the area grew into the temple complex. The construction activity between 1574 and 1604 is described in Mahima Prakash Vartak, a semi-historical Sikh hagiography text likely composed in 1741, and the earliest known document dealing with the lives of all the ten Gurus. Guru Arjan installed the scripture of Sikhism inside the new gurdwara in 1604. Continuing the efforts of Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan established Amritsar as a primary Sikh pilgrimage destination. He wrote a voluminous amount of Sikh scripture including the popular Sukhmani Sahib. <br><br>
Guru Ram Das acquired the land for the site. Two versions of stories exist on how he acquired this land. In one, based on a Gazetteer record, the land was purchased with Sikh donations of 700 rupees from the people and owners of the village of Tung. In another version, Emperor Akbar is stated to have donated the land to the wife of Guru Ram Das.

In 1581, Guru Arjan initiated the construction of the Gurdwara.[1] During the construction the pool was kept empty and dry. It took 8 years to complete the first version of the Harmandir Sahib. Guru Arjan planned a gurdwara at a level lower than the city to emphasise humility and the need to efface one's ego before entering the premises to meet the Guru.[1] He also demanded that the gurdwara compound be open on all sides to emphasise that it was open to all. The sanctum inside the pool where his Guru seat was, had only one bridge to emphasise that the end goal was one, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair.[1] In 1589, the gurdwara made with bricks was complete. Guru Arjan is believed by some later sources to have invited the Sufi saint Mian Mir of Lahore to lay its foundation stone, signalling pluralism and that the Sikh tradition welcomed all.[1] This belief is however unsubstantiated.[29][30] According to Sikh traditional sources such as Sri Gur Suraj Parkash Granth it was laid by Guru Arjan himself.[31] After the inauguration, the pool was filled with water. On 16 August 1604, Guru Arjan completed expanding and compiling the first version of the Sikh scripture and placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the gurdwara. He appointed Baba Buddha as the first Granthi.[32]

Ath Sath Tirath, which means "shrine of 68 pilgrimages", is a raised canopy on the parkarma (circumambulation marble path around the pool).[3][8][33] The name, as stated by W. Owen Cole and other scholars, reflects the belief that visiting this temple is equivalent to 68 Hindu pilgrimage sites in the Indian subcontinent, or that a Tirath to the Golden Temple has the efficacy of all 68 Tiraths combined.[34][35] The completion of the first version of the Golden Temple was a major milestone for Sikhism, states Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, because it provided a central pilgrimage place and a rallying point for the Sikh community, set within a hub of trade and activity.[1]
